# ML_CourseProject
 
### Project for the Coursera Machine Learning course. 

This project seeks to predict the manner in which the users of the fitness device did the exercise. Devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and FitBit are able to collect vast amounts of data about the way in which people perform exercise. Using this data, enthusiasts are trying to predict (originally) how much exercise they did, while now we can predict how well we did the exercise.

This project was a great introduction the using ML techniques but has not been improved on since the project date. There are many ways to more accurately forecast using the latest ML techniques and so this project should be used mainly as a platform for which to begin your ML journey.

Executable writeup is: "MachineLearning.Rmd"
